What is Plugify?

#content
Plugify is a **modern C++ plugin and package manager** designed to simplify and enhance plugin development across multiple programming languages. It provides a unified environment for creating, managing, and extending plugins, enabling seamless communication between plugins written in different languages. Plugify is ideal for game development, software extensibility, and cross-language projects.

How do I create a new language module?

#content
To create a new language module:

1. Implement the `ILanguageModule` interface provided by Plugify.
2. Compile the module with the same C++ version and compiler as the Plugify core.
3. Place the compiled module in the `res/extensions` folder.
4. Update the `plugify.pconfig` file to include the new module.

Refer to the [Language Module Development Guide](/developer-guide) for detailed instructions.

#title
What are Manifest Files?

#content
Manifest files are JSON configuration files used by Plugify to define metadata and settings for plugins, language modules, and the core system. There are three types of manifest files:

1. **`.pplugin` (Plugin Manifest)**:
   - Defines metadata for a plugin, such as its name, version, dependencies, and entry point.
   - Must be placed in the plugin's folder and named exactly the same as the folder.
   - Example:
     ```json
     {
         "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/untrustedmodders/plugify/refs/heads/main/schemas/plugin.schema.json",
         "name": "my_plugin",
         "version": "1.0.0",
         "dependencies": [],
         "entry": "bin/plugin_name"
     }
     ```

2. **`.pmodule` (Language Module Manifest)**:
   - Defines metadata for a language module, such as its name, version, and supported languages.
   - Must be placed in the module's folder and named exactly the same as the folder.
   - Example:
     ```json
     {
         "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/untrustedmodders/plugify/refs/heads/main/schemas/module.schema.json",
         "name": "cpp_module",
         "version": "1.0.0",
         "language": "cpp"
     }
     ```

3. **`plugify.pconfig` (Core Configuration Manifest)**:
   - Defines global settings for the Plugify core, such as the base directory, logging level, and repositories.
   - Must be placed in the root directory of your project.
   - Example:
     ```json
     {
         "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/untrustedmodders/plugify/refs/heads/main/schemas/config.schema.json",
         "baseDir": "res",
         "logSeverity": "debug",
         "repositories": [],
         "preferOwnSymbols": false
     }
     ```

#title
What are File Structure?

#content
Plugify requires a specific folder structure for plugins and language modules. Below is an example of how your `res` directory should be organized:

   ::file-tree
   ---
   tree:
   - res:
      - ^plugins^:
         - plugin_name1:
            - bin:
               - plugin_name1.dll
               - plugin_name1.so
            - plugin_name1.pplugin
         - plugin_name2:
            - plugin_name2.py
            - plugin_name2.pplugin
      - ^modules^:
         - cpp_language_module:
            - bin:
               - cpp_module.dll
               - cpp_module.so
            - cpp_module.pmodule
         - python_language_module:
            - bin:
               - python_module.dll
               - python_module.so
            - python_module.pmodule
      - plugify.pconfig
