## Implementations

If you’re using Plugify for game modding (e.g., Counter-Strike 2), you’ll need to install **S2-Plugify** or **MMS2-Plugify**. These projects provide pre-configured setups for specific games.

## Running the Testing App

The `plug` app allows you to test plugins and language modules locally. Follow these steps to get started:

::steps
### Clone the Repository
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Clone the Plugify repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/untrustedmodders/plugify.git
   ```

### Build the Project
1. Navigate to the Plugify directory:
   ```
   cd plugify
   ```
2. Create a `build` folder and configure the project with CMake:
   ```
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake ..
   ```
3. Build the project:
   ```
   cmake --build . --target plug
   ```

### Set Up the `res` Directory
1. Create a `res` folder in the root of the repository:
   ```
   mkdir ../res
   ```
2. Inside the `res` folder, create two subfolders:
   ```
   mkdir ../res/plugins
   mkdir ../res/modules
   ```
3. Place your plugins in the `plugins` folder and language modules in the `modules` folder.

### Configure `plugify.pconfig`
The `plug` app requires a configuration file named `plugify.pconfig` in the working directory. This file specifies the path to the `res` folder and other settings.

1. Create a `plugify.pconfig` file in the root of the repository (or the working directory where you run `plug`).
2. Add the following content to the file:
   ```json
   {
       "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/untrustedmodders/plugify/refs/heads/main/schemas/config.schema.json",
       "baseDir": "res",
       "logSeverity": "debug",
       "repositories": [],
       "preferOwnSymbols": false
   }
   ```
    - **`baseDir`**: Specifies the directory where plugins and language modules are located (default: `res`).
    - **`logSeverity`**: Controls the logging level (e.g., `debug`, `info`, `error`).
    - **`repositories`**: A list of remote repositories for downloading packages (leave empty for local testing).
    - **`preferOwnSymbols`**: Determines whether Plugify should prefer its own symbols over those provided by plugins (set to `false` for most use cases).

### Run the Testing App
1. Navigate to the `build` directory and run the `plug` app:
   ```
   ./plug
   ```
2. The app will load any plugins and language modules located in the `res` folder.
