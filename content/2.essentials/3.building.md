## Upgrading

To update your local repository to the latest version:

```
git fetch
git pull
git submodule update --remote --merge
```

If the build fails, try removing the `build` directory and re-creating it as described above. Note that the build process makes no modifications outside the `build` directory.

## Build Types

Plugify supports multiple build types, which can be specified using the `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` variable. The default build type is `RelWithDebInfo`. Additionally, Plugify provides **presets** for `Debug` and `Release` builds to simplify the process.

### Available Build Types
- **Debug**:
    - Enables debugging symbols and disables optimizations.
    - Ideal for development and troubleshooting.
    - Use this preset for local builds when you need detailed debugging information.

- **Release**:
    - Enables optimizations and produces a smaller, faster binary.
    - Uses `RelWithDebInfo` to include debugging symbols for local builds.
    - Ideal for production builds where performance is critical.

- **RelWithDebInfo**:
    - Enables optimizations while including debugging symbols.
    - This is the default build type and is used by the `Release` preset.

- **MinSizeRel**:
    - Enables optimizations for the smallest possible binary size.
    - Ideal for environments where disk space or memory usage is a concern.
    - Does not include debugging symbols.

### Using Presets
Plugify provides two presets to simplify the build process:

1. **Debug Preset**:
    - Builds the project with the `Debug` configuration.
    - Use this preset for local development and debugging.
    - Example:
      ```
      cmake ..
      cmake --build . --preset Debug
      ```

2. **Release Preset**:
    - Builds the project with the `Release` configuration, which uses `RelWithDebInfo` to include debugging symbols for local builds.
    - Use this preset for production-ready builds.
    - Example:
      ```
      cmake ..
      cmake --build . --preset Release
      ```

### Specifying Build Types Manually
If you prefer to specify the build type manually, you can use the `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` variable:

```
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -G Ninja ..
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G Ninja ..
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -G Ninja ..
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=MinSizeRel -G Ninja ..
```

## Customizing Plugify

Plugify provides several CMake options for customization:

## Testing the Build

Plugify includes a custom testing system designed to validate the functionality of containers (e.g., strings, variants, vectors) used in language modules and plugins. This system relies on two key components:

- **`cross_call_worker`**: A plugin that implements methods to be called by the `cross_call_master`.
- **`cross_call_master`**: A plugin that calls methods from the `cross_call_worker` and instructs it to call methods back.

These plugins are used to test **marshalling** (data exchange between plugins written in different languages) and ensure compatibility across language modules.

### How It Works
1. **`cross_call_master`** calls methods from the **`cross_call_worker`** of another language module.
2. **`cross_call_worker`** calls methods back on the **`cross_call_master`**.
3. This bidirectional communication tests the marshalling system and ensures that data is correctly passed between plugins.

### Running the Tests
To run the tests, you need to:
1. Build the **testing app** (`plug`).
2. Build the **language modules** and **plugins** (`cross_call_worker` and `cross_call_master`).
3. Configure the `res` directory to include the required plugins and language modules.

::steps{level=4}
#### Build the Testing App
Follow the [Installation](/essentials/installation) instructions to get the `plug` testing app.

:read-more{icon="lucide:link" to="/essentials/installation"}

#### Build Language Modules and Plugins
1. Navigate to the repository directory and create a build folder:
```
mkdir build
cd build
```
2. Generate build files and enable testing:
```
cmake -DPLUGIFY_BUILD_TESTS=ON ..
```
3. Build the language modules and plugins individually. For example:
```
cmake --build . --target cross_call_worker
cmake --build . --target cross_call_master
```
**Note**: Ensure each plugin or language module is built separately to avoid conflicts and ensure proper compilation.

#### Configure the `res` Directory
1. Create a `res` folder in the root of the repository:
```
mkdir ../res
```
2. Inside the `res` folder, create two subfolders:
```
mkdir ../res/extensions
```
3. Copy the built plugins and language modules to the `res` folder:
- Place `cross_call_worker` and `cross_call_master` in `res/extensions/`.
- Place the language modules (e.g., `cpp-module`, `python-module`) in `res/extensions/`.

#### Run the Tests
1. Navigate to the `build` directory and run the `plug` app:
   ```
   ./plug
   ```
2. The app will load the plugins and language modules, and the tests will run automatically.

::

### Example Test Workflow
1. **`cross_call_master`** calls a method from **`cross_call_worker`** to pass a string.
2. **`cross_call_worker`** processes the string and calls a method back on **`cross_call_master`** to return a modified string.
3. The test verifies that the string was correctly passed and returned.

## Building Documentation
