Plugify is designed to be easily integrated into your projects, whether you're building a game modding platform, a standalone application, or a plugin-based system. This guide will walk you through the process of integrating Plugify into your project using **CMake**, covering both **external** and **embedded** integration methods.

## Integration Methods

### 1. **External Integration**
To use Plugify as an external library, you can locate it directly with `find_package()` in your CMake project. This method is ideal if you want to keep Plugify as a separate dependency.

#### Example:
::code-group
```cmake [CMakeLists.txt]
find_package(plugify REQUIRED)
...
add_library(foo ...)
...
target_link_libraries(foo PRIVATE plugify::plugify)
```
::

### 2. **Embedded Integration**
If you prefer to embed Plugify directly into your project, you can include the entire source tree as a subdirectory. This method is useful if you want to customize or extend Plugify's functionality.

#### Example:
::code-group
```cmake [CMakeLists.txt]
# Disable tests for third-party libraries
set(PLUGIFY_BUILD_TESTS OFF CACHE INTERNAL "")

# Add Plugify as a subdirectory
add_subdirectory(plugify)
...
add_library(foo ...)
...
target_link_libraries(foo PRIVATE plugify::plugify)
```
::

### 3. **Embedded Integration with FetchContent**
For projects using CMake 3.11 or later, you can use the `FetchContent` module to automatically download and integrate Plugify at configure time.

#### Example:
::code-group
```cmake [CMakeLists.txt]
include(FetchContent)

FetchContent_Declare(
plugify
URL https://github.com/untrustedmodders/plugify/releases/download/v1.0.0/plugify.tar.xz
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(plugify)

target_link_libraries(foo PRIVATE plugify::plugify)
```
::

**Note**: The URL approach is recommended for stable releases. For more details, see the [FetchContent documentation](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.11/module/FetchContent.html).

### 4. **Supporting Both External and Embedded Integration**
If you want your project to support both external and embedded integration, you can use the following pattern:

#### Top-Level
::code-group
```cmake [CMakeLists.txt]
project(FOO)
...
option(FOO_USE_EXTERNAL_PLUGIFY "Use an external Plugify library" OFF)
...
add_subdirectory(thirdparty)
...
add_library(foo ...)
...
target_link_libraries(foo PRIVATE plugify::plugify)
```
::

#### Thirdparty
::code-group
```cmake [thirdparty/CMakeLists.txt]
if(FOO_USE_EXTERNAL_PLUGIFY)
    find_package(plugify REQUIRED)
else()
    add_subdirectory(plugify)
endif()
```
::

In this setup, `thirdparty/plugify` should contain a complete copy of the Plugify source tree.

## Example: Initializing Plugify in Your Application

Once integrated, you can initialize Plugify in your application as follows:

::code-group
```c++ [main.cpp]
int main() {
   // Create a Plugify instance
   std::shared_ptr<plugify::IPlugify> instance = plugify::MakePlugify();
   if (instance) {
	   // Set up logging
	   auto logger = std::make_shared<CustomLogger>();
	   instance->SetLogger(logger);
	   logger->SetSeverity(plugify::Severity::Debug);

		 // Initialize Plugify
		 if (!instance->Initialize()) {
			 std::cerr << "Failed to initialize Plugify!" << std::endl;
			 return EXIT_FAILURE;
		 }
	   
		 // Access the Package Manager
		 if (auto packageManager = instance->GetPackageManager().lock()) {
			 packageManager->Initialize();
	   
			 // Handle missing or conflicted packages
			 if (packageManager->HasMissedPackages()) {
				 std::cerr << "Plugin manager has missing packages." << std::endl;
				 packageManager->InstallMissedPackages();
			 }
			 if (packageManager->HasConflictedPackages()) {
				 std::cerr << "Plugin manager has conflicted packages." << std::endl;
				 packageManager->UninstallConflictedPackages();
			}
		 }
	   
		 // Access the Plugin Manager
		 if (auto pluginManager = instance->GetPluginManager().lock()) {
			pluginManager->Initialize();
		}
	}
	return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```
::

## Best Practices

1. **Use Consistent Build Environments**:
    - Ensure that Plugify and your project are built with the same compiler and C++ version to avoid compatibility issues.

2. **Disable Unnecessary Features**:
    - If you donâ€™t need tests or documentation, disable them using CMake options like `PLUGIFY_BUILD_TESTS` and `PLUGIFY_BUILD_DOCS`.

3. **Handle Errors Gracefully**:
    - Always check the return values of Plugify's initialization and management functions to handle errors effectively.

4. **Use FetchContent for Stable Releases**:
    - When using `FetchContent`, prefer downloading stable releases from GitHub to ensure compatibility and reliability.

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing Packages**: If the Package Manager reports missing packages, ensure that the required packages are available in the configured directories or repositories.
- **Conflicted Packages**: Resolve conflicts by uninstalling or updating the conflicting packages.
- **Build Errors**: Verify that your CMake configuration matches Plugify's requirements (e.g., C++20, compatible compilers).
