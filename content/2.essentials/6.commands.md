Plugify provides a powerful Command Line Interface (CLI) for managing plugins, language modules, and packages. Below is a comprehensive list of available commands, organized by functionality.

## **Important Note**
The commands listed here are **not part of the Plugify core itself**. Instead, they are implemented manually by each project that integrates Plugify. This is because different projects may have unique input systems, CLI frameworks, or user interaction requirements. The examples provided in this documentation are based on the implementations used in **MM2-Plugify** and **S2-Plugify**, which are specific to those projects. Your implementation may vary depending on your project's needs.

### Manage Repositories

#### Add a Repository

```

**Note**: Only add repositories from trusted sources to avoid security risks.

#### Create a Snapshot
Generate a snapshot of all installed packages into a manifest file. The file will be saved in the base directory.

```bash
plg snapshot
```

## **Best Practices**
- Always use the `--ignore` flag with caution, as it may lead to unstable behavior if dependencies are missing or conflicted.
- Regularly update your packages to ensure compatibility and security.
- Use snapshots to back up your package configurations before making significant changes.
