Plugify provides a powerful Command Line Interface (CLI) for managing plugins, language modules, and packages. Below is a comprehensive list of available commands, organized by functionality.

## **Important Note**
The commands listed here are **not part of the Plugify core itself**. Instead, they are implemented manually by each project that integrates Plugify. This is because different projects may have unique input systems, CLI frameworks, or user interaction requirements. The examples provided in this documentation are based on the implementations used in **MM2-Plugify** and **S2-Plugify**, which are specific to those projects. Your implementation may vary depending on your project's needs.

## **Plugin Manager Commands**

### Load Plugin Manager
Load the plugin manager with plugins and language modules.

```bash
plg load
```

### Unload Plugin Manager
Unload the plugin manager and all associated plugins and language modules.

```bash
plg unload
```

## **Search Commands**

### Show Plugin Information
Display detailed information about a specific plugin.

```bash
plg plugin _plugin_name_
```

### Show Module Information
Display detailed information about a specific language module.

```bash
plg module _module_name_
```

### List Running Modules
List all currently loaded language modules.

```bash
plg modules
```

### List Running Plugins
List all currently loaded plugins.

```bash
plg plugins
```

## **Miscellaneous Commands**

### Show Help
Display the help menu with a list of available commands.

```bash
plg help
```

### Version Information
Display the current version of Plugify.

```bash
plg --version
```

# **Package Manager Commands**

[Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a fast, drop-in replacement for conda and uses the same CLI patterns and configuration. This guide replaces the old Plugify (`plg`) commands with **mamba** equivalents and gives a few practical notes for migrating your workflows.

### Install Packages
Install one or more packages by name:

```bash
mamba install package_name1 package_name2 ...
```

**Options**:

- Install packages from a local package list (one package per line):

  ```bash
  mamba install --file /path/to/package_file.txt
  ```

  *(This accepts the same file-format as `conda install --file` — a simple list of package specs.)*

- Create an environment from an `environment.yml` (recommended for reproducible envs):

  ```bash
  mamba env create -f environment.yml
  ```

  - If your manifest is a remote URL, fetch it then create:

    ```bash
    curl -sL https://website.com/environment.yml -o environment.yml
    mamba env create -f environment.yml
    ```

  *(Using environment YAMLs is the standard way to capture full environment metadata.)* 

- Install packages and let mamba resolve dependencies (default behavior):

  ```bash
  mamba install package_name --yes
  ```

  *(Mamba resolves and installs dependencies automatically; avoid disabling dependency resolution unless you know what you’re doing.)*

---

### Update Packages
Update one or more installed packages:

```bash
mamba update package_name1 package_name2 ...
```

**Options**:
- Update all installed packages:

  ```bash
  mamba update --all
  ```

*(Same command style as conda — `mamba` is a drop-in replacement here.)*

---

### Remove Packages
Remove one or more installed packages:

```bash
mamba remove package_name1 package_name2 ...
```

**Options**:
- Remove all packages in an environment (remove the env):

  ```bash
  mamba env remove -n your_env_name
  ```

- Force-remove or change dependency behavior only with caution (e.g. `--no-deps`); these flags can break environments.

### Search for Packages

#### List Local Packages
Display all locally installed packages:

```bash
mamba list
```

#### List Remote Packages (available in configured channels)
Show packages available in remote repositories (search across channels):

```bash
mamba search
```

#### Search Remote Packages (by name)
Search for remote packages by name:

```bash
mamba search package_name
```

#### Show Local Package Info
Show locally installed package information:

```bash
mamba list package_name
```

*(`mamba search` and `mamba list` mirror conda usage; use `mamba repoquery` for deeper repository dependency queries if you need them.)*

---

### Manage Repositories / Channels

#### Add a Channel (temporary)
Use `-c` to specify a channel for a single install:

```bash
mamba install -n your_env_name -c channel_name_or_url package_name
```

#### Add a Channel (permanent)
Add a remote repository (channel) to your configuration permanently:

```bash
mamba config --add channels https://website.com/conda_channel/
```

**Note**: Only add channels from trusted sources. Channel order and priority matter — prefer a pinned channel list (e.g., `conda-forge` then `defaults`) to avoid unexpected package mixes.

### Create a Snapshot / Export Environment
For backups and reproducibility, export the environment in one of two common ways:

- Export a YAML environment spec (cross-platform, recommended):

  ```bash
  mamba env export -n your_env_name > environment.yml
  ```

- Create an *explicit* spec file for bit-for-bit reproducibility on the same OS:

  ```bash
  mamba list --explicit > spec-file.txt
  # recreate from spec:
  mamba create --name MY_ENV --file spec-file.txt
  ```

*(Explicit spec files are single-platform but great for exact restores; YAML is more portable.)*
