## Installation Steps

::steps
### **Download Plugify**
Download the latest version of **MMS2-Plugify** from our download page:  
[MMS2-Plugify Download](https://github.com/untrustedmodders/mms2-plugify).

### **Extract Plugify**
Extract the downloaded archive into your server’s game folder. For example, if your server’s game folder is located at `../my_server/game/csgo`, extract the files there.

### **Start/Restart the Server**
After extracting the files, start or restart your server to apply the changes.

### **Validate the Installation**
To ensure that Plugify has been installed correctly, open your server console and type the following command:

```bash
meta list
```

If you are not working directly on your server, use `rcon` to access the console. The output should look something like this:

```bash
meta list
Listing 1 plugin:
[01] Plugify (1.0.0.0) by untrustedmodders
```
::

### **Alternative Validation**
You can also verify the installation by using the version command in the server console:

```bash
plg version
```

This will display the current version of Plugify installed on your server.
