Keeping your **MMS2-Plugify** installation up to date is essential for accessing the latest features, bug fixes, and security improvements. This guide will walk you through the manual and automatic update processes.

## **Manual Update**

Since **MMS2-Plugify** is a Metamod plugin, it must be updated manually. Follow these steps to update your installation:

::steps
### **Delete the Old Files**
1. Navigate to your server’s game folder (e.g., `../my_server/game/csgo`).
2. Delete the entire `../addons/plugify/bin/` directory. This ensures that no outdated files remain.

### **Install the New Version**
1. Download the latest version of **MMS2-Plugify** from our download page:  
   [MMS2-Plugify Download](https://github.com/untrustedmodders/mms2-plugify).
2. Extract the new files into your server’s game folder, following the [installation tutorial](/use-cases/metamod-plugin/installation/).

### **Restart the Server**
Restart your server to apply the updates. Verify the update by running the following command in your server console:

```bash
meta list
```

The output should display the updated version of Plugify.

## **Automatic Update**

Plugify seamlessly integrates with a **package manager**, a tool that automates the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing packages (plugins and language modules) in a consistent manner. Each plugin and language module is considered a package, and the package manager simplifies the management of these components.

### **Using the Package Manager**
To update plugins and language modules automatically, follow these steps:

::steps{level=4}
#### **Unload the Plugin Manager**:  
   Before updating, unload the plugin manager to ensure that no plugins or modules are in use. Run the following command in your server console:

   ```bash
   plg unload
   ```

#### **Update Packages**:  
   Run the following command to update all installed packages:

   ```bash
   plg update --all
   ```

   This will check for updates to plugins and language modules and install them automatically.

#### **Reload the Plugin Manager**:  
   After updating, reload the plugin manager to apply the changes:

   ```bash
   plg load
   ```

#### **Restart the Server**:  
   Restart your server to ensure that all updates are applied correctly.
::

## **Important Note**
The **package manager cannot update itself or the core Plugify library** at this time. To update Plugify, you must follow the **manual update process** described above.

## **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**
1. **Update Fails**:
   - Ensure that the `../addons/plugify/bin/` directory is deleted before installing the new version.
   - Verify that you have the correct permissions to modify files in the server directory.

2. **Package Manager Errors**:
   - If the package manager fails to update, check your internet connection and ensure that the repository URLs in `plugify.pconfig` are correct.
   - Run the following command to resolve missing or conflicted packages:

     ```bash
     plg install --missing
     ```

3. **Server Crashes After Update**:
   - Check the server logs for errors related to Plugify or its dependencies.
   - Ensure that all plugins and language modules are compatible with the updated version of Plugify.
