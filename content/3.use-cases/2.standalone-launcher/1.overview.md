**S2-Launcher** allows Plugify to run as a standalone game launcher, executing the game directly while loading custom plugins. This implementation does not rely on MetaMod, making it ideal for scenarios where a lightweight, independent solution is preferred.

### Key Features
- **Standalone Execution**: No dependency on MetaMod or other external frameworks.
- **Direct Plugin Loading**: Full control over plugin loading and game execution.
- **Lightweight**: Optimized for fast and efficient performance.

### Use Cases
- **Standalone Modding**: Load custom plugins directly into Source 2 games without requiring MetaMod.
- **Custom Game Launchers**: Create tailored game launchers that load specific plugins or configurations.
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Quickly test and iterate on plugins during development.

### Example
A developer creating a custom mod for *Deadlock* can use S2-Launcher to launch the game with their plugin loaded, allowing them to test new features or gameplay mechanics without needing to integrate with MetaMod.

### Benefits
- **Lightweight**: No external dependencies, reducing complexity and potential conflicts.
- **Developer-Friendly**: Simplifies the development and testing process for plugins.
- **Full Control**: Enables highly customized setups for specific use cases.
