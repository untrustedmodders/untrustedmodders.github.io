This guide will walk you through the installation process for **S2-Launcher**, a standalone launcher for **S2-Launcher**. Unlike MM-Loader, S2-Launcher does not require Metamod and is designed to run the game while injecting Plugify directly. Follow the steps below to get everything set up.

## Prerequisites

::steps
### **Download S2-Launcher**
Download the latest version of **S2-Launcher** from our download page:  
[S2-Launcher Download](https://github.com/untrustedmodders/plugify-source2-launcher).
::

## Installation Steps

::steps
### **Extract S2-Launcher**
Extract the downloaded archive into your game’s installation folder. For example, if your game is installed at `../Counter-Strike Global Offensive`, extract the files there.

After extraction, your folder structure should look like this:

::file-tree
---
tree:
- Counter-Strike Global Offensive:
    - game:
        - bin:
            - win64:
                - cs2.exe
                - ^s2launcher.exe^
            - linuxsteamrt64:
                - cs2
                - ^s2launcher^
        - core:
        - csgo:
            - addons:
                - plugify:
                    - extensions/
            - ^plugify.pconfig^
        - csgo_core/
        - csgo_imported/
        - csgo_lv/
    - installscript

### **Use S2-Launcher**
Instead of running the game’s main executable (`cs2.exe` or `cs2`), use the **S2-Launcher** (`s2launcher.exe` or `s2launcher`) to start the game. The launcher will automatically inject Plugify into the game process.

#### On Windows:
1. Navigate to the `bin/win64` folder.
2. Run `s2launcher.exe` instead of `cs2.exe`.

#### On Linux:
1. Navigate to the `bin/linuxsteamrt64` folder.
2. Run `./s2launcher` instead of `./cs2`.

### **Validate the Installation**
To ensure that Plugify has been installed correctly, open the in-game console and type the following command:

```bash
plg --version
```

This will display the current version of Plugify running in your game.

### **Install Plugins and Language Modules**

After validating that Plugify is working correctly, you'll need to install plugins and language modules to start developing and running plugins.

#### **Install Basic Source 2 Plugins**

These are the essential plugins required for developing Source 2 plugins. Open the in-game console and run:

```bash
# Install C++ language module (required to run C++ plugins)
mamba install -n modules -c "https://untrustedmodders.github.io/plugify-module-cpp/" plugify-module-cpp

# Install plugin configuration support
mamba install -n plugins -c "https://untrustedmodders.github.io/plugify-plugin-configs/" plugify-plugin-configs

# Install PolyHook for function hooking
mamba install -n plugins -c "https://untrustedmodders.github.io/plugify-plugin-polyhook/" plugify-plugin-polyhook

# Install Source 2 SDK plugin (provides Source 2 game functions)
mamba install -n plugins -c "https://untrustedmodders.github.io/plugify-plugin-s2sdk/" plugify-plugin-s2sdk
```

**What these plugins do:**
- **plugify-module-cpp**: Language module that allows you to run C++ plugins
- **plugify-plugin-configs**: Provides configuration file support for plugins
- **plugify-plugin-polyhook**: Enables function hooking capabilities
- **plugify-plugin-s2sdk**: Core plugin with many Source 2 engine functions and utilities

#### **Install Additional Language Modules (Optional)**

If you want to develop plugins in languages other than C++, install the corresponding language module:

```bash
# For C# plugins
mamba install -n modules -c "https://untrustedmodders.github.io/plugify-module-dotnet/" plugify-module-dotnet

# For Python plugins
mamba install -n modules -c "https://untrustedmodders.github.io/plugify-module-python3/" plugify-module-python3

# For JavaScript plugins
mamba install -n modules -c "https://untrustedmodders.github.io/plugify-module-v8/" plugify-module-v8

# For Go plugins
mamba install -n modules -c "https://untrustedmodders.github.io/plugify-module-golang/" plugify-module-golang

# For Lua plugins
mamba install -n modules -c "https://untrustedmodders.github.io/plugify-module-lua/" plugify-module-lua

# For Rust plugins
mamba install -n modules -c "https://untrustedmodders.github.io/plugify-module-rust/" plugify-module-rust

# For D plugins
mamba install -n modules -c "https://untrustedmodders.github.io/plugify-module-dlang/" plugify-module-dlang
```

Choose only the language modules you need for your development.

#### **Verify Installed Plugins**

Check that your plugins and modules are installed by running in the console:

```bash
plg modules
plg plugins
```

This will show all installed plugins and their status.

## Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**
1. **Game Fails to Start**:
    - Ensure that `s2launcher.exe` (or `s2launcher` on Linux) is located in the same folder as the game’s main executable.
    - Verify that you have the correct permissions to run the launcher.

2. **Plugify Commands Not Working**:
    - Ensure that the launcher is running and that Plugify has been injected successfully.
    - Check the game’s console for any error messages related to Plugify.

3. **Missing Files**:
    - Verify that all files were extracted correctly and that the folder structure matches the example above.


4. **Dedicated Server Not Starting**:
    - If you are running a dedicated server, ensure that you provide the same arguments to `s2launcher.exe` (or `s2launcher`) as you would to `cs2.exe` (or `cs2`). For example:
     ```bash
     s2launcher.exe -dedicated -console -usercon +game_type 0 +game_mode 1 +map de_dust2
     ```
      This ensures that the launcher passes the correct parameters to the game executable.
