This guide will walk you through the installation process for **S2-Launcher**, a standalone launcher for **S2-Plugify**. Unlike MMS2-Plugify, S2-Launcher does not require Metamod and is designed to run the game while injecting Plugify directly. Follow the steps below to get everything set up.

## Prerequisites

::steps
### **Download S2-Plugify**
Download the latest version of **S2-Plugify** from our download page:  
[S2-Plugify Download](https://github.com/untrustedmodders/s2-plugify).

## Installation Steps

::steps
### **Extract S2-Plugify**
Extract the downloaded archive into your game’s installation folder. For example, if your game is installed at `../Counter-Strike Global Offensive`, extract the files there.

After extraction, your folder structure should look like this:

tree:
- Counter-Strike Global Offensive:
    - game:
        - bin:
            - win64:
                - cs2.exe
                - ^s2-plugify.exe^
            - linuxsteamrt64:
                - cs2
                - ^s2-plugify^
        - core:
        - csgo:
            - addons:
                - plugify:
                    - extensions/
            - ^plugify.pconfig^
        - csgo_core/
        - csgo_imported/
        - csgo_lv/
    - installscript

### **Use S2-Launcher**
Instead of running the game’s main executable (`cs2.exe` or `cs2`), use the **S2-Launcher** (`s2-plugify.exe` or `s2-plugify`) to start the game. The launcher will automatically inject Plugify into the game process.

#### On Windows:
1. Navigate to the `bin/win64` folder.
2. Run `s2-plugify.exe` instead of `cs2.exe`.

#### On Linux:
1. Navigate to the `bin/linuxsteamrt64` folder.
2. Run `./s2-plugify` instead of `./cs2`.

### **Validate the Installation**
To ensure that Plugify has been installed correctly, open the in-game console and type the following command:

```bash
plg --version
```

This will display the current version of Plugify running in your game.

## Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**
1. **Game Fails to Start**:
    - Ensure that `s2-plugify.exe` (or `s2-plugify` on Linux) is located in the same folder as the game’s main executable.
    - Verify that you have the correct permissions to run the launcher.

2. **Plugify Commands Not Working**:
    - Ensure that the launcher is running and that Plugify has been injected successfully.
    - Check the game’s console for any error messages related to Plugify.

3. **Missing Files**:
    - Verify that all files were extracted correctly and that the folder structure matches the example above.


4. **Dedicated Server Not Starting**:
    - If you are running a dedicated server, ensure that you provide the same arguments to `s2-plugify.exe` (or `s2-plugify`) as you would to `cs2.exe` (or `cs2`). For example:
     ```bash
     s2-plugify.exe -dedicated -console -usercon +game_type 0 +game_mode 1 +map de_dust2
     ```
      This ensures that the launcher passes the correct parameters to the game executable.
