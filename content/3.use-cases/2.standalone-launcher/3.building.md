This guide provides instructions for building **S2-Launcher**, a standalone launcher for Plugify designed to run games while injecting Plugify directly. The build process is nearly identical to building the core Plugify library, with one key difference: the target name should be `plugify-source2-launcher` instead of `plugify`.

## **Key Difference**
When building **S2-Launcher**, ensure that you specify the target name as `plugify-source2-launcher` instead of `plugify`. For example:

```bash
cmake --build . --target plugify-source2-launcher
```

## **Steps to Build S2-Launcher**

::steps
### **Clone the Repository**
Clone the **S2-Launcher** repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/untrustedmodders/plugify-source2-launcher.git --recursive
cd plugify-source2-launcher
```

### **Generate Build Files**
Create a `build` directory and generate the build files using CMake:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

### **Build the Project**
Build the project using the following command. **Note**: The target name is `s2launcher`.

```bash
cmake --build . --target plugify-source2-launcher
```

### **Verify the Build**
Once the build process is complete, the compiled files will be located in the `build` directory. Verify the build by checking for the following files:
- `s2launcher.exe` (Windows)
- `s2launcher` (Linux)

## **Detailed Build Instructions**
For more detailed instructions on building Plugify (e.g., configuring CMake options, enabling tests, or building documentation), refer to the [Building Plugify](/essentials/building) guide. The process is identical, except for the target name (`plugify-source2-launcher` instead of `plugify`).

## **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**
1. **Build Fails**:
    - Ensure that you have the correct version of CMake and a compatible C++ compiler installed.
    - Verify that all dependencies are available and properly configured.

2. **Target Not Found**:
    - Double-check that you are using the correct target name (`plugify-source2-launcher`).

3. **Missing Files**:
    - Ensure that the repository was cloned correctly and that all files are present.
