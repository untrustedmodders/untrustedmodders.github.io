Keeping your **S2-Plugify** installation up to date is essential for accessing the latest features, bug fixes, and security improvements. This guide will walk you through the manual and automatic update processes.

## **Manual Update**

Since **S2-Plugify** is a standalone launcher, it must be updated manually. Follow these steps to update your installation:

::steps
### **Delete the Old Files**
1. Navigate to your game’s installation folder (e.g., `../Counter-Strike Global Offensive/game/bin/win64` or `../Counter-Strike Global Offensive/game/bin/linuxsteamrt64`).
2. Delete the following files:
    - `s2-plugify.exe` (Windows) or `s2-plugify` (Linux).
    - The `../addons/plugify/bin/` directory (if it exists).

### **Install the New Version**
1. Download the latest version of **S2-Plugify** from our download page:  
   [S2-Plugify Download](https://github.com/untrustedmodders/s2-plugify).
2. Extract the new files into your game’s installation folder, following the [installation tutorial](/use-cases/standalone-launcher/installation/).

### **Restart the Game**
Run the updated `s2-plugify.exe` (Windows) or `./s2-plugify` (Linux) to start the game. Verify the update by running the following command in the in-game console:

```bash
plg version
```

The output should display the updated version of Plugify.

## **Automatic Update**

Plugify seamlessly integrates with a **package manager**, a tool that automates the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing packages (plugins and language modules) in a consistent manner. Each plugin and language module is considered a package, and the package manager simplifies the management of these components.

### **Using the Package Manager**
To update plugins and language modules automatically, follow these steps:

::steps{level=4}
#### **Unload the Plugin Manager**:  
   Before updating, unload the plugin manager to ensure that no plugins or modules are in use. Run the following command in the in-game console:

   ```bash
   plg unload
   ```

#### **Update Packages**:  
   Run the following command to update all installed packages:

   ```bash
   plg update --all
   ```

   This will check for updates to plugins and language modules and install them automatically.

#### **Reload the Plugin Manager**:  
   After updating, reload the plugin manager to apply the changes:

   ```bash
   plg load
   ```

#### **Restart the Game**:  
   Restart the game to ensure that all updates are applied correctly.

## **Important Note**
The **package manager cannot update itself or the core Plugify library** at this time. To update **S2-Plugify**, you must follow the **manual update process** described above.

## **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**
1. **Update Fails**:
    - Ensure that the old `s2-plugify.exe` (or `s2-plugify`) and `../addons/plugify/bin/` directory are deleted before installing the new version.
    - Verify that you have the correct permissions to modify files in the game directory.

2. **Package Manager Errors**:
    - If the package manager fails to update, check your internet connection and ensure that the repository URLs in `plugify.pconfig` are correct.
    - Run the following command to resolve missing or conflicted packages:

     ```bash
     plg install --missing
     ```

3. **Game Crashes After Update**:
    - Check the game logs for errors related to Plugify or its dependencies.
    - Ensure that all plugins and language modules are compatible with the updated version of Plugify.
