The **Python Language Module** (`plugify-module-python3.12`) is a core component of Plugify that enables the creation and management of Python plugins. This guide will walk you through the process of building the module from source.

## **Prerequisites**

Before building the Python Language Module, ensure you have the following installed:

- **CMake** (version 3.14 or later)
- **C++ Compiler** (supporting C++20 or later, for native components)
    - Clang 15+
    - GCC 11+
    - MSVC 2022+
- **Plugify Core Library** (built and available)

## **Steps to Build the Python Language Module**

::steps
### **Clone the Repository**
Clone the `plugify-module-python3.12` repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/untrustedmodders/plugify-module-python3.12.git --recursive
cd plugify-module-python3.12
```

### **Generate Build Files**
Create a `build` directory and generate the build files using CMake:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

### **Build the Module**
Build the module using the following command. The target name is `plugify-module-python3.12`.

```bash
cmake --build . --target plugify-module-python3.12
```

### **Verify the Build**
Once the build process is complete, the compiled module will be located in the `build` directory. Verify the build by checking for the following files:
- `plugify-module-python3.12.dll` (Windows)
- `libplugify-module-python3.12.so` (Linux)
- `libplugify-module-python3.12.dylib` (macOS)

## **Integrating the Python Language Module**

After building the module, you can integrate it into your Plugify setup:

1. Copy the compiled module file to the `modules` directory of your Plugify installation.
2. Ensure the Plugify core library is properly configured to load the module.
3. Start Plugify, and the Python Language Module will be automatically detected and loaded.

## **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**
1. **Build Fails**:
    - Ensure that you have the correct version of CMake, Python 3.12, and a compatible C++ compiler installed.
    - Verify that the Plugify core library is built and available.

2. **Module Not Loaded**:
    - Ensure the module file is placed in the correct directory (`modules`).
    - Check the Plugify logs for any errors related to module loading.

3. **Missing Symbols**:
    - Ensure that the module is built with the same compiler and C++ version as the Plugify core library.

## **Advanced Configuration**
