Debugging is an essential part of developing C++ plugins for Plugify. This guide provides an overview of how to debug C++ plugins effectively and directs you to external resources for detailed instructions.

## **Prerequisites**

Before debugging your C++ plugins, ensure you have the following:

- **Visual Studio** (2022 or later) or another C++ IDE with debugging capabilities.
- **Plugify Core Library** (built and available).
- **C++ Language Module** (\`plugify-module-cpp\`) installed and configured.
- A compiled C++ plugin to debug.

## **Debugging C++ Plugins**

Debugging C++ plugins involves attaching a debugger to the running Plugify process and setting breakpoints in your plugin code. Below are the general steps to debug C++ plugins:

::steps
### **Set Up Your Development Environment**
- Ensure your C++ plugin project is configured for debugging (e.g., built in **Debug** mode).
- Open your plugin project in **Visual Studio** or your preferred IDE.

### **Attach the Debugger to Plugify**
1. Launch Plugify with your C++ plugin loaded.
2. In Visual Studio, go to **Debug > Attach to Process**.
3. Find the Plugify process in the list and click **Attach**.

### **Set Breakpoints**
- Open the source files for your C++ plugin in Visual Studio.
- Set breakpoints in your code by clicking in the left margin next to the line numbers.

### **Debug Your Plugin**
- Trigger the functionality in your plugin that you want to debug.
- The debugger will pause execution at your breakpoints, allowing you to inspect variables, step through code, and analyze the call stack.

## **Detailed Debugging Guide**

For a comprehensive step-by-step guide on debugging C++ applications, refer to Microsoft's official documentation:

## **Common Debugging Scenarios**

### **1. Plugin Crashes**
- Check the Plugify logs for error messages.
- Use the debugger to identify the exact line of code causing the crash.
- Inspect variables and memory to diagnose the issue.

### **2. Plugin Not Loading**
- Verify that the plugin is compiled correctly and placed in the correct directory.
- Check for missing dependencies or incompatible versions.
- Use the debugger to step through the plugin initialization code.

### **3. Unexpected Behavior**
- Set breakpoints in the relevant functions to trace the flow of execution.
- Inspect variable values to identify discrepancies.
- Use conditional breakpoints to debug specific scenarios.

## **Advanced Debugging Tips**

### **1. Use Logging**
- Add logging statements to your plugin code to track execution flow and variable values.
- Use Plugify's built-in logging system to output messages to the console or log files.

### **2. Memory Debugging**
- Use tools like **Valgrind** (Linux) or **AddressSanitizer** to detect memory leaks and invalid memory access.
- In Visual Studio, use the **Memory Window** to inspect memory usage.

### **3. Debugging Multithreaded Code**
- Use the **Threads Window** in Visual Studio to monitor and debug multiple threads.
- Be cautious of race conditions and deadlocks.

## **Troubleshooting**

### **1. Debugger Not Attaching**
- Ensure Plugify is running and the plugin is loaded.
- Verify that the plugin is built in **Debug** mode.

### **2. Breakpoints Not Hit**
- Ensure the plugin code matches the compiled binary.
- Rebuild the plugin and restart Plugify.

### **3. Debugger Crashes**
- Update Visual Studio to the latest version.
- Ensure all dependencies are compatible with your development environment.
