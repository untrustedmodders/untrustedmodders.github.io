Debugging JavaScript plugins that are embedded in C++ applications, such as Plugify, requires using the **V8 Inspector** to inspect and troubleshoot your JavaScript code. This guide provides an overview of how to debug JavaScript plugins in this context and directs you to external resources for detailed instructions.

## **Prerequisites**

Before debugging your JavaScript plugins, ensure you have the following:

- **V8 Engine** (version 11.0 or later) installed and configured.
- **Node.js** (optional, for running the debugger).
- **Plugify Core Library** (built and available).
- **V8 Language Module** (\`plugify-module-v8\`) installed and configured.
- A JavaScript plugin to debug.

## **Debugging JavaScript Plugins with V8 Inspector**

The V8 Inspector allows you to debug JavaScript code running in the V8 engine. Below are the general steps to debug JavaScript plugins embedded in C++ applications:

::steps
### **Enable V8 Inspector in Plugify**
1. Ensure the V8 Language Module is configured to enable the V8 Inspector.
2. Launch Plugify with your JavaScript plugin loaded.

### **Connect to the V8 Inspector**
1. Open a browser (e.g., Chrome or Edge) and navigate to `chrome://inspect`.
2. Under **Devices**, click **Configure** and add the address and port where the V8 Inspector is running (e.g., `localhost:9229`).
3. Your JavaScript plugin should appear under **Remote Target**. Click **Inspect** to open the DevTools.

### **Set Breakpoints**
- Open the JavaScript source files for your plugin in the DevTools.
- Set breakpoints in your code by clicking in the left margin next to the line numbers.

### **Debug Your Plugin**
- Trigger the functionality in your plugin that you want to debug.
- The debugger will pause execution at your breakpoints, allowing you to inspect variables, step through code, and analyze the call stack.

## **Detailed Debugging Guide**

For a comprehensive step-by-step guide on using the V8 Inspector, refer to the official V8 documentation:

## **Common Debugging Scenarios**

### **1. Plugin Crashes**
- Check the Plugify logs for error messages.
- Use the V8 Inspector to identify the exact line of code causing the crash.
- Inspect variables and memory to diagnose the issue.

### **2. Plugin Not Loading**
- Verify that the plugin is placed in the correct directory.
- Check for missing JavaScript dependencies or syntax errors.
- Use the V8 Inspector to step through the plugin initialization code.

### **3. Unexpected Behavior**
- Set breakpoints in the relevant functions to trace the flow of execution.
- Inspect variable values to identify discrepancies.
- Use conditional breakpoints to debug specific scenarios.

## **Advanced Debugging Tips**

### **1. Use Logging**
- Add logging statements to your JavaScript plugin code to track execution flow and variable values.
- Use Plugify's built-in logging system to output messages to the console or log files.

### **2. Debugging Asynchronous Code**
- Use the **Async Call Stack** feature in DevTools to trace asynchronous function calls.
- Inspect Promises and async/await functions to identify issues.

### **3. Debugging Memory Issues**
- Use the **Memory** tab in DevTools to take heap snapshots and analyze memory usage.
- Identify memory leaks and optimize your plugin's memory consumption.

## **Troubleshooting**

### **1. Debugger Not Connecting**
- Ensure Plugify is running and the V8 Inspector is enabled.
- Verify that the correct address and port are configured in the browser.

### **2. Breakpoints Not Hit**
- Ensure the JavaScript code matches the version being executed.
- Rebuild the plugin and restart Plugify.

### **3. Debugger Crashes**
- Update V8 to the latest version.
- Ensure all dependencies are compatible with your development environment.
