Debugging Go plugins in Plugify involves using tools like **Delve**, the Go debugger, to inspect and troubleshoot your code. This guide provides an overview of how to debug Go plugins and directs you to external resources for detailed instructions.

## **Prerequisites**

Before debugging your Go plugins, ensure you have the following:

- **Go** (version 1.20 or later) installed and configured.
- **Delve** (the Go debugger) installed. You can install it using:
  ```bash
  go install github.com/go-delve/delve/cmd/dlv@latest
  ```
- **Plugify Core Library** (built and available).
- **Go Language Module** (\`plugify-module-golang\`) installed and configured.
- A Go plugin to debug.

## **Debugging Go Plugins**

Debugging Go plugins involves using Delve to attach to the running Plugify process and set breakpoints in your Go code. Below are the general steps to debug Go plugins:

### **1. Set Up Your Development Environment**
- Ensure your Go plugin is built in **Debug** mode.
- Open your Go plugin project in your preferred IDE or text editor (e.g., **VS Code**).

### **2. Launch Plugify with Debugging Enabled**
1. Start Plugify with your Go plugin loaded.
2. Ensure the Go plugin is properly initialized and running.

### **3. Attach Delve to Plugify**
1. Use Delve to attach to the Plugify process:
   ```bash
   dlv attach <Plugify-PID>
   ```
   Replace `<Plugify-PID>` with the process ID of Plugify.

2. Alternatively, you can start Plugify with Delve directly:
   ```bash
   dlv exec ./plugify -- <plugify-arguments>
   ```

### **4. Set Breakpoints**
- Open the Go source files for your plugin.
- Set breakpoints in your code by adding the following line where you want to pause execution:
  ```go
  runtime.Breakpoint()
  ```
- Alternatively, use your IDE's debugging interface to set breakpoints.

### **5. Debug Your Plugin**
- Trigger the functionality in your plugin that you want to debug.
- The debugger will pause execution at your breakpoints, allowing you to inspect variables, step through code, and analyze the call stack.

## **Detailed Debugging Guide**

For a comprehensive step-by-step guide on debugging Go applications, refer to the official Go debugging documentation:

## **Common Debugging Scenarios**

### **1. Plugin Crashes**
- Check the Plugify logs for error messages.
- Use Delve to identify the exact line of code causing the crash.
- Inspect variables and memory to diagnose the issue.

### **2. Plugin Not Loading**
- Verify that the plugin is compiled correctly and placed in the correct directory.
- Check for missing dependencies or incompatible versions.
- Use Delve to step through the plugin initialization code.

### **3. Unexpected Behavior**
- Set breakpoints in the relevant functions to trace the flow of execution.
- Inspect variable values to identify discrepancies.
- Use conditional breakpoints to debug specific scenarios.

## **Advanced Debugging Tips**

### **1. Use Logging**
- Add logging statements to your Go plugin code to track execution flow and variable values.
- Use Plugify's built-in logging system to output messages to the console or log files.

### **2. Debugging Goroutines**
- Use Delve's `goroutines` command to list all active goroutines.
- Inspect the state of each goroutine to identify potential issues.

### **3. Debugging Race Conditions**
- Use the Go race detector to identify race conditions:
  ```bash
  go run -race main.go
  ```
- Use Delve to debug the problematic sections of code.

## **Troubleshooting**

### **1. Debugger Not Attaching**
- Ensure Plugify is running and the plugin is loaded.
- Verify that Delve is installed and configured correctly.

### **2. Breakpoints Not Hit**
- Ensure the Go plugin code matches the compiled binary.
- Rebuild the plugin and restart Plugify.

### **3. Debugger Crashes**
- Update Delve to the latest version.
- Ensure all dependencies are compatible with your development environment.
