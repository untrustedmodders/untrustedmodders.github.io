Welcome to the **Plugify D Language Module Plugin Development Guide**. This guide will walk you through the process of creating your first plugin using D within the Plugify framework. Whether you’re a **game modder, software engineer, or plugin developer**, this tutorial will help you understand the fundamental concepts and steps necessary to build a fully functional plugin.

### What is Plugify?

Plugify is a **modular plugin framework** that enables developers to extend applications by integrating external plugins dynamically. It provides a structured approach to plugin development with clear guidelines on **plugin structure, dependency management, and API exposure**.

### Why Use D?

The D Language Module allows developers to create high-performance plugins using D. By leveraging **D’s efficiency and modern features**, developers can extend applications while maintaining flexibility and performance. Plugify ensures that your plugin integrates smoothly with the core framework by following a standardized plugin structure and API.

### What You’ll Learn
In this guide, you will:
1. [x] Set up the **directory structure** for your plugin.
2. [x] Define a **plugin manifest** (`.pplugin` file) to register your plugin in the Plugify ecosystem.
3. [x] Write the **D code** for your plugin using the provided API.
4. [x] Manage **dependencies** to ensure correct plugin initialization.
5. [x] Compile and package your plugin into a **shared library**.

By the end of this tutorial, you’ll have a working D plugin that can be loaded into the Plugify framework. Let’s get started!

## Directory Structure

To ensure seamless integration with the Plugify framework, your plugin must follow a specific directory structure. Each plugin should be placed inside its own folder within the `extensions` directory. The folder name must match the plugin’s name and follow these rules:

1. [x] **Allowed Characters**: Alphanumeric (`A-Z, a-z, 0-9`), special characters (`_`).
2. [x] **Spaces are NOT allowed** in the folder name.
3. [x] The `.pplugin` configuration file must have the **same name** as the plugin folder.

### Example Directory Layout

::file-tree

tree:
- res/extensions:
    - d_example_plugin:
        - bin:
            - d_example_plugin.dll
            - libd_example_plugin.so
        - ^d_example_plugin.pplugin^
    - another-plugin:
        - bin:
            - another-plugin.dll
            - libanother-plugin.so
        - ^another-plugin.pplugin^
---

### Breakdown of the Structure

* `res/extensions/` – The main directory where all plugins are stored.
* `d_example_plugin/` – Each plugin has its own dedicated folder. The folder name must match the `.pplugin` file name.
* `bin/` – This subfolder contains the compiled plugin binaries (`.dll` for Windows, `.so` for Linux).
* `d_example_plugin.pplugin` – The configuration file that defines metadata about the plugin.

By following this structure, Plugify can correctly **detect, load, and manage plugins** across different platforms.

## The Plugin Manifest

Each plugin in the **Plugify** framework requires a **manifest file** with the `.pplugin` extension. This file is a **JSON-based configuration** that provides essential metadata about the plugin, ensuring that it can be properly identified, loaded, and managed.

### Key Responsibilities of the Manifest File:
* Defines the **plugin version** and **author details**.
* Specifies the **entry point** for execution.
* Lists **dependencies** required by the plugin.
* Declares **exported methods** available for external interaction.

### Example of a `.pplugin` File

::code-group
```json [d_example_plugin.pplugin]
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/untrustedmodders/plugify/refs/heads/main/schemas/plugin.schema.json",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "name": "DExamplePlugin",
  "description": "An example of a D plugin. This can be used as a starting point when creating your own plugin.",
  "author": "untrustedmodders",
  "website": "https://github.com/untrustedmodders/",
  "license": "MIT",
  "entry": "bin/d_example_plugin.dll",
  "platforms": [],
  "language": "dlang",
  "dependencies": [],
  "methods": [],
  "classes": []
}
```
::

### Key Fields Explained

* `entry`: Specifies the **location** of the compiled plugin binary (`.dll` or `.so`).
* `language`: Should be set to **dlang** for D plugins.
* `dependencies`: Lists other **required plugins**, ensuring correct load order.
* `methods`: **Functions** exposed by the plugin for external interaction.
* `classes`: **Classes** exported by the plugin that can be instantiated or used by other plugins.

### Why is the Manifest File Important?

* **Ensures Compatibility** – Defines supported versions and platforms.
* **Enables Modularity** – Lists dependencies for structured plugin loading.
* **Facilitates Integration** – Allows other plugins to call exposed methods.

By following this manifest structure, **Plugify** can efficiently load and manage plugins, ensuring **seamless functionality** across different projects.

## Writing the Plugin Code

Creating a plugin for Plugify is straightforward. You can either use the **pre-built D plugin template** available in our repository or write your plugin from scratch.

### Using the Plugin Template

The easiest way to get started is by downloading the **D plugin template** from our repository. It contains all the necessary files, including:

* A **preconfigured project structure**
* A **sample implementation**
* The required **d-plugify** package

Just clone the [repository](https://github.com/untrustedmodders/plugify-plugin-dlang-template/), and your environment will be ready for development.

### Writing a Plugin from Scratch

If you prefer to build your plugin manually, follow these steps:

#### Setting Up Your Plugin
Each plugin must use the `d-plugify` package to define lifecycle methods (`OnPluginStart`, `OnPluginUpdate`, `OnPluginEnd`).

#### Plugin Code Structure
Here is a basic example of a **D plugin** implementation:

::code-group
```cpp [plugin.d]
module main;

import std.stdio;
import bindbc.system; // Assuming a similar D package for event handling

extern(C) void Plugify_PluginStart() {
    writeln("D: OnPluginStart");
}

extern(C) void Plugify_PluginUpdate(float dt) {
    writeln("D: OnPluginUpdate");
}

extern(C) void Plugify_PluginEnd() {
    writeln("D: OnPluginEnd");
}

shared static this() {
}
```
::

#### Understanding Plugin Lifecycle Methods

Each plugin can define the following lifecycle methods, which Plugify will call at specific times:

| Method                     | Description                                            | Required?      |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| `OnPluginStart`            | Called when the plugin is loaded and ready to run.     | ❌ Optional   |
| `OnPluginUpdate(float dt)` | Called every frame, allowing periodic updates.         | ❌ Optional   |
| `OnPluginEnd`              | Called when the plugin is unloaded or shuts down.      | ❌ Optional   |

::alert{type="warning" icon="lucide:triangle-alert"}
These methods are optional. If not implemented, the language module will not call them.
::

## Dependency Management

Dependency management in **Plugify** ensures that plugins are loaded in the correct order based on their dependencies. The system uses Topological Sorting to determine the appropriate sequence, preventing initialization issues when plugins rely on other plugins.

### How Dependencies Work
Each plugin can declare its dependencies inside the `dependencies` field of its **plugin manifest** (`.pplugin` file). The Plugify core will:

* Analyze the dependencies listed in each plugin's manifest.
* Sort the plugins using [Topological Sorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting), ensuring dependencies are loaded before dependent plugins.
* Validate platform compatibility and requested versions.

### Dependency Representation

Dependencies are declared using the following JSON format inside the `dependencies` field of the **plugin manifest**:

::code-group
```json [plugin_name.pplugin]
"dependencies": [
    {
        "name": "polyhook",
        "optional": false,
        "constraints": ">=1.0.0 <2.0.0"
    }
]
```

#### Explanation of Fields

| Field         | Type                 | Required?               | Description                                                                                    |
|---------------|----------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`        | `string`             | ✅ Yes                   | The unique name of the dependency plugin.                                                      |
| `optional`    | `boolean`            | ❌ No (default: `false`) | If `true`, the plugin can still load even if the dependency is missing.                        |
| `constraints` | `string`             | ❌ No                    | Specifies a required version of the dependency. If omitted, any compatible version is allowed. |

## Building the Plugin

To build your plugin, you need to compile it into a **shared library** (`.dll` for Windows, `.so` for Linux). You can use Dub (D’s package manager) or compile manually.

### Using Dub

1. Add the plugify dependency to your dub.json or dub.sdl file:
    ```json 
    { 
        "dependencies": { 
            "plugify": "~>1.0.0"
        }
    }
    ```

2. Run the following command to build the plugin:
    ```bash 
    dub build --build=release --compiler=ldc2
    ```

### Compiling Manually

1. Use the following command to compile the plugin:
    ```bash 
    ldc2 -shared -of=d_example_plugin.dll source/app.d
    ```

2. Replace `source/app.d` with the path to your D source file.

3. Replace `d_example_plugin.dll` with the desired output file name.

## Running and Testing the Plugin

Once you have built your plugin, the next step is to **run and test it** within the Plugify system. To do this, follow these steps:

### Placing the Plugin in the Correct Directory
Ensure your plugin is correctly structured inside the `extensions` folder. Your plugin directory should contain:

Once the **plugin folder and manifest file** are correctly placed, Plugify will **automatically detect and attempt to load the plugin**.

### Verifying Plugin Load Status
You can check if your plugin **loaded successfully** by using terminal commands provided by Plugify. These commands allow you to **query the status** of plugins and troubleshoot potential issues.

- **List all loaded plugins**:
```bash
plg plugins
```
This will display all currently **loaded** plugins. If your plugin is listed, it means Plugify successfully recognized and initialized it.

- **Query specific plugin information**:
```bash
plg plugin d_example_plugin
```
This command retrieves **detailed information** about a specific plugin, including its version, dependencies, and supported platforms.

### Debugging Issues
If your plugin isn't working as expected:
- **Check the console logs** for detailed error messages.
- **Ensure all dependencies are properly installed** and compatible with the game/platform.
- **Verify the entry point** in the `.pplugin` manifest matches the actual plugin binary location.
- **Enable debug logging** if necessary, to get more details about the issue.

Once your plugin loads and functions correctly, it's ready for use! Would you like additional information on debugging techniques?
