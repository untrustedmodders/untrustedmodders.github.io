Welcome to the **Rust Language Module** for Plugify! This module allows developers to create and integrate **Rust plugins** seamlessly within the Plugify ecosystem. Whether you're building high-performance systems, implementing safe concurrency, or extending existing applications, Rust provides a **powerful, safe, and efficient way** to work with Plugify.

## What is the Rust Language Module?

The **Rust Language Module** enables **native Rust development** within Plugify, giving developers the ability to:

1. [x] Create **high-performance, memory-safe plugins** using Rust
2. [x] Interact with other plugins and modules within Plugify
3. [x] Leverage Rust's **ownership system** for guaranteed memory safety
4. [x] Use **existing Rust crates** to enhance functionality

The module is designed to provide **maximum safety and performance** while maintaining flexibility to interact with the wider Plugify ecosystem.

## Why Use Rust for Plugify?

Rust is known for its **speed, safety, and concurrency**, making it an excellent choice for **reliable and performant applications**, including:

- **Game Development & Modding**
- **High-Performance Computing**
- **Systems Programming**
- **Safe Concurrent Systems**
- **Memory-Safe Native Extensions**

If you're looking for a way to **build fast, safe, and reliable plugins**, the **Rust Language Module** is the perfect solution!

## How Does It Work?

Using the Rust Language Module, you can:

1. **Write your plugin** in Rust
2. **Load it into Plugify** as a dynamic library
3. **Enable communication** between your plugin and others
4. **Leverage existing Plugify features** in a **safe Rust environment**

Plugify takes care of the **plugin management**, **loading**, and **interoperability**, so you can focus on building great features with Rust's safety guarantees!

## Who is This For?

This module is ideal for:

- **Rust Developers** looking to integrate their skills into Plugify
- **Systems Programmers** who need high-performance plugin solutions
- **Software Engineers** working with **safe native extensions**
- **Anyone who wants memory safety without garbage collection**
- **Developers prioritizing correctness and reliability**
