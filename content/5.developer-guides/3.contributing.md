Thank you for your interest in contributing to Plugify! We welcome contributions from the community, whether it's improving the source code, enhancing the documentation, or fixing bugs. Below, you'll find guidelines on how to contribute effectively.

## **How to Contribute**

To contribute to Plugify, please use [GitHub's pull request functionality](https://github.com/your-username/plugify/pulls). If you're new to pull requests, you can learn more about them on the [GitHub help page](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

When creating a pull request, please:
- Provide a clear description of the changes you made.
- Explain the reason for the changes.
- Reference any related issues or discussions.

Once submitted, we will review your pull request, discuss any necessary changes, and either merge or close it. If your contribution is successful, we’ll gladly add you to our [credits page](/introduction/credits) (if you wish).

## **Contributing to the Source Code**

If you're contributing to the source code, please follow these steps:

1. **Test Your Changes**: Ensure that your changes work as expected and do not introduce new issues.
2. **Follow Coding Conventions**: Adhere to our coding style guidelines. We recommend using our [Clang-Format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) and [Clang-Tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/) configurations to automatically format your code.

### **Coding Style**
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Keep functions small and focused.
- Add comments where necessary to explain complex logic.
- Follow the existing code structure and patterns.

Always test your changes thoroughly before submitting a pull request. This helps ensure that your contribution is ready for review and integration.

## **Contributing to the Documentation**

Plugify's documentation is built using [Shadcn-Docs](https://shadcn-docs-nuxt.vercel.app/), and the source files are located in the [documentation repository](https://github.com/untrustedmodders/untrustedmodders.github.io). Documentation contributions are also submitted via pull requests.

### **Documentation Structure**
- **Wiki Pages**: Simple markdown files in the `docs` directory.
- **Source Code Documentation**: Generated using Doxygen. Configuration files are located in the `docs` directory.

### **Doxygen Documentation**
The source code is documented using Doxygen. Here’s an example of how to document a function:

```c++
/**
 * @file
 * @brief Brief description of the file.
 */

/**
 * @brief Brief description of the function.
 *
 * Detailed description of the function.
 */
void exampleFunction();
```

If you need to manually document specific parts of the code, you can extend or modify the Doxygen configuration file for the relevant module.

::alert{type="info" icon="lucide:info"}
If you make changes to the source code documentation directly in the source code, you **must** regenerate the documentation using Doxygen to ensure the changes are reflected in the HTML output.
::

## **Building the Documentation Locally**

Before submitting a pull request, you should test your changes by building the documentation locally. This ensures that the HTML output is correct and looks good.

### **Steps to Build Documentation**
1. Navigate to the `build` directory:
   ```bash
   cd build
   ```
2. Configure the build with Doxygen enabled:
   ```bash
   cmake .. -DPLUGIFY_BUILD_DOCS=ON
   ```
3. Build the documentation:
   ```bash
   cmake --build . --target docs
   ```
4. View the documentation in your browser:
   ```bash
   your_favorite_browser docs/html/index.html
   ```

### **Automating the Build Process**
To save time, you can create an alias in your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`):
```bash
alias docbuild='cd docs && doxygen Doxyfile'
```
Now, you can simply run `docbuild` in your terminal to generate the documentation.

::alert{icon="lucide:info"}
Using aliases can significantly speed up your workflow. For example, you can create an alias for building the documentation to avoid typing long commands repeatedly.
::

## **CI/CD Pipeline**

Once your pull request is merged, our CI/CD pipeline will automatically:
1. Build the documentation.
2. Update the wiki.
3. Publish the changes.

This process typically takes 10-15 minutes.

::alert{icon="lucide:info"}
The CI/CD pipeline ensures that your changes are quickly integrated and published. If you encounter any issues, feel free to reach out to us.

## **Tips for Contributors**
- **Communication**: If you're unsure about something, feel free to ask questions in the [Discord community](https://discord.gg/untrustedmodders) or open an issue on GitHub.
- **Small Changes**: Break large contributions into smaller, manageable pull requests.
- **Testing**: Always test your changes thoroughly before submitting a pull request.

::alert{icon="lucide:info"}
Small, focused pull requests are easier to review and merge. If you're working on a large feature, consider breaking it into smaller, incremental changes.
