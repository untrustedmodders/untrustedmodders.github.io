Debugging Plugify-related issues can be challenging, especially since our packages (modules and plugins) are published in **Release mode without symbols** by default. This page provides a comprehensive guide to help you debug effectively, whether you're troubleshooting Plugify itself, a plugin, or a game like CS2.

## **Building with Symbols**

To debug effectively, you need access to debugging symbols. Since our published packages do not include symbols, you will need to build the modules or plugins yourself. Here’s how:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the Plugify repository or the repository of the module/plugin you want to debug.
2. **Build in `Debug` or `RelWithDebInfo` Mode**: Configure the build to include debugging symbols.
    - For CMake projects, use the `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` flag.
   ```bash
   cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
   cmake --build .
   ```
3. **Use the Debug Build**: Replace the Release version of the module/plugin with the Debug version you just built.

Debug builds are larger and slower than Release builds but provide the necessary symbols for effective debugging.

## **Debugging CS2 or Other Source2 Games**

Plugify is often used with games like CS2. Debugging these games requires specific tools and configurations. Below are instructions for Windows and Linux/macOS.

### **Debugging on Windows**

The most efficient approach on Windows is to use **Visual Studio 2022** as a debugger.

#### **Steps to Debug CS2 with Visual Studio**
1. **Open the Executable**:
    - In Visual Studio, go to `File > Open > Project/Solution`.
    - Select the game executable (e.g., `cs2.exe`).

2. **Set Command-Line Arguments**:
    - Go to `Project > Properties > Debugging`.
    - In the `Command Arguments` field, add everything you usually use to run your server.

3. **Configure Debugger Type**:
    - For C++ code, leave the debugger type as **Auto**.
    - For debugging C# scripts, set the debugger type to **Mixed (.NET Core + 5)**.

4. **Disable I/O Redirection**:
    - CS2 has a custom console that can crash Visual Studio or corrupt output if I/O redirection is enabled.
    - Disable I/O redirection by unchecking `Redirect Output` in the debugging settings.

5. **Run the Debugger**:
    - Start debugging by pressing `F5`.
    - If a crash occurs, Visual Studio will provide detailed information, including stack traces and variable states.

Debugging with symbols significantly improves the quality of stack traces and removes obfuscation from function names.

### **Debugging on Linux/macOS**

On Linux and macOS, you can use **GDB** or **LLDB** for debugging. While these tools can be used externally, integrating them with an IDE provides a better debugging experience.

#### **Using GDB/LLDB Externally**
1. **Start the Game with GDB/LLDB**:
   ```bash
   gdb ./cs2
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   lldb ./cs2
   ```

2. **Set Breakpoints and Run**:
    - Set breakpoints using `break <function_name>`.
    - Run the game using `run`.

3. **Inspect Crashes**:
    - If the game crashes, use `bt` (backtrace) to inspect the stack trace.

#### **Using an IDE**
- **Visual Studio (via Wine)**: Run Visual Studio using Wine for a familiar debugging experience.
- **CLion**: Use CLion with native Linux debugging support. CLion integrates with GDB/LLDB for a seamless debugging experience.

If you’re running the game in a Docker container, note that Docker does not support LLDB. In this case, you must use GDB.

## **Debugging Plugify and Plugins**

Most issues you encounter will likely be related to plugins or language modules rather than Plugify itself. Here’s how to debug these components:

1. **Build with Debug Symbols**: As mentioned earlier, build the plugin or language module in Debug mode.
2. **Set Breakpoints**: Use your debugger to set breakpoints in the plugin or module code.
3. **Inspect Logs**: Plugify provides detailed logs that can help identify issues. Enable verbose logging if necessary.
4. **Reproduce the Issue**: Run the game or application with the debugger attached to reproduce the issue.

## **Common Debugging Scenarios**

### **1. Crashes in Plugins**
- **Cause**: Invalid memory access, null pointers, or unhandled exceptions.
- **Solution**: Use the debugger to inspect the stack trace and identify the problematic code.

### **2. Performance Issues**
- **Cause**: Inefficient code or resource leaks.
- **Solution**: Use profiling tools (e.g., Valgrind on Linux) to identify bottlenecks.

### **3. Inter-Language Communication Issues**
- **Cause**: Incorrect type conversion or marshalling.
- **Solution**: Verify that the exported functions and their parameters are correctly defined and handled.

## **Tips for Effective Debugging**
- **Enable Verbose Logging**: Plugify’s logs can provide valuable insights into what’s happening under the hood.
- **Use Breakpoints Strategically**: Set breakpoints in critical areas of your code to inspect variable states and execution flow.
- **Reproduce the Issue**: Try to isolate the issue by creating a minimal reproducible example.
- **Ask for Help**: If you’re stuck, reach out to the community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/untrustedmodders) or open an issue on GitHub.

## **Conclusion**

Debugging Plugify-related issues requires building modules and plugins with debugging symbols and using the right tools for your platform. On Windows, Visual Studio is the most efficient debugger, while on Linux/macOS, GDB or LLDB are the tools of choice. By following the steps and tips outlined in this guide, you can effectively diagnose and resolve issues in Plugify, plugins, or games like CS2.
