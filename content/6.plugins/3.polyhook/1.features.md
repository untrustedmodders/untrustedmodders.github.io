**PolyHook** is a versatile and powerful C++ plugin designed to provide developers with an easy way to create dynamic function hooks for any call convention with pre and post callbacks. Built using the **AsmJit** machine code generation library and the **Capstone Disassembler** library, PolyHook enables dynamic function hooking for x86/ARM architecture with support for 32/64-bit modes on Windows and Linux platforms. It is designed for use with **C++20 or later** and is based on stevemk14ebr's **PolyHook_2_0** library.

## **Key Features**

### **1. Dynamic Function Hooking**
- Hook any function at runtime, regardless of its call convention.
- Supports **x86** and **x64** architectures on **Windows** and **Linux**.

### **2. Pre and Post Callbacks**
- Easily add **pre-call** and **post-call** hooks to monitor or modify function behavior.
- Execute custom logic before or after the original function is called.

### **3. Cross-Platform Compatibility**
- Works seamlessly on **Windows** and **Linux**.
- Supports both **32-bit** and **64-bit** applications.

### **4. Built on AsmJit and Capstone**
- Utilizes the **AsmJit** library for dynamic machine code generation.
- Leverages the **Capstone Disassembler** for precise instruction analysis.

### **5. Easy Integration**
- Designed for use with **C++20 or later**.
- Simple and intuitive API for quick integration into your projects.

### **6. Customizable Hooks**
- Create hooks for specific functions or entire classes.
- Modify function arguments or return values dynamically.

### **7. Lightweight and Efficient**
- Minimal overhead for high-performance applications.
- Optimized for both speed and memory usage.

## **Use Cases**

### **1. Game Modding**
- Hook game functions to add new features or modify existing behavior.
- Create custom overlays, cheats, or debugging tools.

### **2. Software Debugging**
- Monitor function calls to diagnose issues or analyze performance.
- Log function arguments and return values for debugging purposes.

### **3. Security Applications**
- Intercept and analyze function calls for security auditing.
- Prevent unauthorized function execution or data access.

### **4. Plugin Development**
- Extend the functionality of existing applications by hooking into their APIs.
- Create plugins for software that doesn't natively support extensibility.
