The **DynCall Plugin** leverages the **dyncall library** to provide a powerful and flexible way to call C functions dynamically at runtime. This plugin encapsulates architecture-, OS-, and compiler-specific function call semantics into a simple interface, allowing developers to bind arguments manually and issue calls programmatically. Written in **C and assembly**, DynCall is lightweight, efficient, and easy to integrate into your projects.

## **Key Features**

### **1. Dynamic Function Calls**
- Call C functions dynamically at runtime without requiring their signatures at compile time.
- Bind arguments manually and issue calls programmatically.

### **2. Cross-Platform Compatibility**
- Works seamlessly across different architectures (x86, x64, ARM) and operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS).
- Handles architecture-specific calling conventions automatically.

### **3. Simple and Intuitive API**
- Provides a clean and minimalistic C interface for easy integration.
- Supports both **C** and **C++** projects.

### **4. Manual Argument Binding**
- Push function arguments manually in the correct order before issuing the call.
- Supports all standard C data types, including integers, floats, pointers, and structs.

### **5. Lightweight and Efficient**
- Minimal overhead for high-performance applications.
- Optimized for both speed and memory usage.

### **6. Extensible and Customizable**
- Easily extendable to support custom calling conventions or data types.
- Ideal for use in scripting engines, plugin systems, and dynamic linking.

## **Use Cases**

### **1. Scripting Engines**
- Implement dynamic function calls for scripting languages.
- Bind native functions to scriptable interfaces.

### **2. Plugin Systems**
- Call plugin functions dynamically without requiring static linking.
- Enable runtime extensibility for applications.

### **3. Debugging and Profiling**
- Intercept and analyze function calls for debugging or profiling purposes.
- Log function arguments and return values dynamically.

### **4. Dynamic Linking**
- Load and call functions from shared libraries (e.g., `.dll` or `.so` files) at runtime.
- Create flexible and modular applications.
