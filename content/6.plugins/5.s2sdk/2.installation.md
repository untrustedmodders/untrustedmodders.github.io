## **Method 2: Installation via Package Manager**

::steps
### **Add the Repository (if needed)**
If the S2SDK Plugin is not found in the default package repository, you need to add the repository manually.

#### **Option A: Add Repository via Command**
1. Run the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   plg repo https://untrustedmodders.github.io/plugify-source-2/s2sdk.json
   ```

#### **Option B: Add Repository via `plugify.pconfig`**
1. Open the `plugify.pconfig` file in your Plugify installation directory.
2. Add the following line under the `repositories` section:
   ```json
   {
     "repositories": [
       "https://untrustedmodders.github.io/plugify-source-2/s2sdk.json"
     ]
   }
   ```

### **Install the Plugin**
1. Run the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   plg install s2sdk
   ```

### **Verify Installation**
1. Start Plugify.
2. The S2SDK Plugin should now be installed and ready for use.

## **Folder Structure**

After installation, the S2SDK Plugin should have the following folder structure:

::file-tree
---
tree:
- res/plugins:
    - s2sdk:
        - bin:
            - s2sdk.dll
            - libs2sdk.so
        - ^s2sdk.pplugin^
---
::

### **Explanation**
- **`res/plugins/s2sdk`**: The root folder for the S2SDK Plugins.
- **`bin`**: Contains the compiled plugin binaries (`.dll` for Windows, `.so` for Linux and `.dylib` for macOS).
- **`s2sdk.pplugin`**: The plugin manifest file that describes the plugin and its exported functions.

## **Troubleshooting**

### **Plugin Not Found**
- Ensure the repository URL is correct and accessible.
- Verify that the repository has been added to `plugify.pconfig` or via the `plg repo <url>` command.

### **Installation Fails**
- Check your internet connection.
- Ensure you have the latest version of Plugify installed.
