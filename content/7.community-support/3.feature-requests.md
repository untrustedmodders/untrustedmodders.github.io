We value your input and ideas! If you have a feature request or an idea to improve Plugify, we encourage you to share it with us. This guide explains how to submit a feature request and what to include to ensure your idea is considered.

## **How to Submit a Feature Request**

To submit a feature request, follow these steps:

::steps

```bash

```

If a similar request exists, you can upvote it by adding a thumbs-up reaction (üëç) to the issue.

### **Create a New Issue**
If your feature request is unique, create a new issue on GitHub:
1. Go to the Plugify GitHub repository:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/untrustedmodders/plugify/issues
   ```
2. Click **New Issue**.
3. Select the **Feature Request** template.
4. Fill out the template with the required information.

### **Provide Detailed Information**
When submitting a feature request, include the following details:
- **Title**: A concise description of the feature.
- **Description**: Explain the feature in detail, including its purpose and benefits.
- **Use Case**: Describe how the feature would be used and who it would benefit.
- **Alternatives**: Mention any existing workarounds or alternatives.
