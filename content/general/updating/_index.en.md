## Manually

1. Delete the entire ``../addons/plugify/bin/`` directory.
2. Continue with the [installation tutorial](/en/general/installation/).

## Automatically

Plugify seamlessly integrates with a package manager, a tool that automates the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing packages (plugins and language modules) in a consistent manner. Each plugin and language module is considered a package, and the package manager simplifies the management of these components.
